1. How did we change our route definitions in order to
   "protect" certain routes from an un-logged-in user?

Wrapped the routes we wanted to protect in a Layout route
that contains logic to redirect someone if they're not logged
in


2. What component can we use to automatically send someone
   to a different route in our app?

<Navigate to="/login" />


3. What component can we render if the user IS logged in?

<Outlet />
