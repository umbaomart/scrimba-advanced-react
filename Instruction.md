/**
   * Challenge: Refactor the Menu components to use the logic
   * from Toggle instead of doing any logic of its own.
   *
   * 1. Remove all context and state logic from the menu components
   * 2. Using Toggle and its "sub-components, add a menu to this
   *    App component below the Star. Make sure to use a separate
   *    <Toggle> wrapper so the state isn't tied to the Star's
   *    Toggle state
