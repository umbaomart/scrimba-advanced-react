/**
 * Challenge:
 * 1. Convert the Menu component to use props.children
 *    instead of taking an `items` prop. (We'll update
 *    the MenuButton and MenuDropdown components later.)
 *    See note inside the Menu.js file for more info
 *
 * 2. import MenuButton and MenuDropdown into THIS file
 *    and render them as children of the Menu component.
 *    Remember to pass the buttonText and items array to
 *    the components that need those props to function.
 *    (We'll also be updating that soon!)
 *
 * NOTE: The functionality of the menu will be broken after
 * these changes, but that's okay! As such, don't worry
 * about moving the state or toggle function from the Menu;
 * there's more we need to learn before we can do that.
