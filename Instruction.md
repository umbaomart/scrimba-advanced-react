/**
 * Challenge - part 2:
 * Make the host navbar indicate the currently-active route.
 *
 * Use the following CSS rules:
 *      font-weight: bold;
 *      text-decoration: underline;
 *      color: #161616;
 *
 * I'd recommend using an inline style this time.
 *
 * NOTE: There will be a small bug that we'll fix
 * after you do the challenge.
