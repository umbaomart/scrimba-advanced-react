/**
 * Challenge: check out the docs linked in the slide, and see if you
 * can implement the Outlet Context feature it talks about.
 *
 * Part of this challenge will require you to (finally) build out those
 * nested components. Again, if you don't need CSS practice, you can
 * skip the styling part, and I'll handle that for you.
