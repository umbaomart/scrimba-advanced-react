/**
 * Challenge:
 * Part 2:
 * Instead of rendering Toggle.On and Toggle.Off, use a single
 * Toggle.Display to render the div below. Toggle.Display will
 * take a function as a child (don't forget to wrap that function
 * in curly braces since it's JS inside of JSX) and will receive
 * the `on` state as its parameter.
 *
 * From that function, you should return the div below, but this
 * time conditionally render the `filled` className based on
 * the value of `on`.
 *
 * You'll know it worked if clicking the box shows a transition
 * between the white background and the blue background. See
 * style.css for details on what's happening there.
