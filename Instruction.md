/**
 * Challenge:
 * 1. Convert the MenuButton to accept children and
 *    render them. (In this case, the children will
 *    just be the button text)
 * 2. Change the MenuButton below to pass "Sports"
 *    in as a child of the component instead of by
 *    using the `buttonText` prop.
 *
 * NOTE: It's fine that the menu is still broken, I
 * promise we're getting there! ðŸ˜ƒ
