# Compound Components Quiz

1. How would you explain the concept of compound components in React to someone who
   only knows the very basics of React?
- Components that work together to accomplish a greater objective than might make
sense to try and accomplish with a single component alone.


2. What are some examples of HTML elements that work together to add functionality
   or styling to each other?
<ul> & <li>, <select> & <option>, <table> & all the other table elements


3. How can compound components help you avoid having to drill props multiple levels
   down?
Compound component "flatten" the heirarchy that I would otherwise need to pass
props through. Since I need to provide the children to render, the parent-most
component has direct access to those "grandchild" components, to which it can
pass whatever props it needs to pass directly.
const state = {}
<select>
    <option>
    <option>
    <option>
</select>
